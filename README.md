Labels are obtained using Xpath descriptors which according to the paper should catch the majority of actionable labels on websites for the purpose of comparisons. As in the paper, the used Xpath descriptors are as follows
```
//div//a//text()
//div//option//text()
```
If this does not catch the wanted actionable labels, it is advisable to experiment with different Xpath descriptors as examined in the paper.
